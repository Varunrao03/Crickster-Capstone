# Crickster - Sport Analytics Predictive Model 

We discuss the analysis role of machine learning in the improvement of performances of players and the team in different sports and how it helps the players to know their performance levels
and further improvements. We aim to make a model which initially collects raw data and these data are stored and clustered since the data is very large .

# Problem Statement
We design a system that can be provide the score and winning prediction in cricket match, the system can analyze multiple parameters like , batting average , bowling average, 
player wise performance etc. while declaring a time for particular championship it is very important to select the best team so that 
the chances of the team winning the championship become easy. 

# Solution
This problem had to be solved to generate the best players for a team for the best result.
To solve this Problem we have collected historical data of some players, and using prediction algorithm like Random Forest algorithm we are 
predicting the best players for the team that can be used in International Tournaments for winning the maximum matches.
